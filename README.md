# Hello-world
This is where I try to learn about git-hub 

Hello! I've been having an incredibly difficult time in my Computer as a Medium Class, so I've taken it upon myself to try to learn why I am having issues. My professor is using Git and Github Which i still yet to trylly define. But while I wait for his response on the matter I will try to teach myself. Seems like this is the natural evolution of education now aday.
